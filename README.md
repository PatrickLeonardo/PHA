# PHA-256-Procedural-Hash-Algorithm (In Development)

The PHA (Procedural Hash Algorithm) is a hashing algorithm that is based on a form of procedural cryptography.

The hash contains a size of 256 bits (32 bytes) with several characters from the Unicode table.

Made to be run in java codes by importing the jar or maven package.

It is currently being developed by only one person, so it may take some time to complete.
