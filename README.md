# PHA-256-Procedural-Hash-Algorithm

PHA-256 (Procedural Hash Algorithm) is a hashing algorithm that is based on a form of procedural cryptography.<br>
The hash contains a size of 256 bits (32 bytes) with several characters from the Unicode table.<br>
Made to be run in java codes by importing the jar or maven package.<br>
It is currently being developed by only one person, so it may take some time to complete.<br>
